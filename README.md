# Simple Iris Flower Prediction App

This application predicts the species of an iris flower based on its physical characteristics.

## Description

This Streamlit app uses a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species (setosa, versicolor, or virginica). Users can input the measurements of the flower's sepal and petal, and the app will predict the most likely species. It also provides the probability of the prediction for each species.

## How it Works

The app is built using Streamlit, a Python library for creating interactive web apps. It utilizes a Random Forest Classifier, a powerful machine learning algorithm, which is trained on the famous Iris dataset.

## Features

- **Interactive Input:**  Users can easily adjust the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width using sliders.
- **Real-time Prediction:** The app instantly predicts the iris species as the user changes the input parameters.
- **Probability Display:** It shows the confidence level of the prediction for each species.
- **User-friendly Interface:** The app is designed with a simple and intuitive layout for easy navigation.
